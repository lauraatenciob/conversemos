# Conversemos

Conversemos emerged from a conversation among friends during a casual gathering, where we realized the need to generate questions to kickstart interesting conversations. From that idea, the project of creating a web application to facilitate this process was born. Conversemos is a web application that helps you initiate conversations with your friends in a fun and stimulating way. It generates random open-ended questions categorized into five different themes so you can choose and enjoy a meaningful conversation.

## Features
- **Categorized questions:** Questions are classified into five categories: Casual, Deep, Spicy, Would You Rather?, and Anecdote of.
- **Simple flow:** It consists of three main views: home page, categories page, and question view.
- **Functional requirements:** 
  1. At least 3 categories.
  2. Each category with at least 10 questions.
  3. Questions displayed in random order.
  4. Avoid repeating questions until all have been shown.
  5. List of questions not visible to the user.
  6. All categories selected by default.
  7. At least one category selected to start the game.
  8. Show the category of each question.
- **Non-functional requirements:**
  1. Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.
  2. Consistent design across all views.

## Design: 
The views were designed using Figma, ensuring an intuitive and attractive interface for the user.
  
## Technologies Used:
The project was developed using React JS and Redux, ensuring efficient data flow and a smooth user experience.

For development purposes, you can create a fork of this repo and run npm install, and then npm starts to launch the development server at localhost:3000.
